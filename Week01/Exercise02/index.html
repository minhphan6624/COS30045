    <h1>Pets and the Pandemic</h1>
    <h2 class="author">Quang Minh Phan</h2>

    <p class="main-text">A report from <strong>Animal Medicines Australia (AMA)</strong> has found that many Australians
        took the opportunity to introduce
        a pet into their household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a significant increase in
        the percent of households taking in a new <i>dog</i>, <i>fish</i> or <i>bird</i>. Their research also indicated
        that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>companionship</li>
        <li>better mental health</li>
        <li>joy and happiness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="main-text">With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers to consider the
        needs
        of companion
        animals and their owners when considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as
        accepting
        animals in public places and transport.
