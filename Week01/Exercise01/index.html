	<p class="main-text">A report from <strong>Animal Medicines Australia (AMA)</strong> has found that many Australians
		took the opportunity to introduce
		a pet into their household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a significant increase in
		the percent of households taking in a new <i>dog</i>, <i>fish</i> or <i>bird</i>. Their research also indicated
		that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>companionship</li>
		<li>better mental health</li>
		<li>joy and happiness.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="main-text">With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers to consider the needs
		of companion
		animals
		and their owners when considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as accepting animals in
		public places and transport.</p>
